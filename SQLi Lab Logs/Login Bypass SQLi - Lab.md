For this lab we need to check for the administrator password.

Since the database doesn't have its inputs sanitized or injection proof we can use a simple injection

``` Username:
adminstrator'--
```

With this simple sentence we got access to an administrator account and the possibility to edit his current email and grant use permanent access.
